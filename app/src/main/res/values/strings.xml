        Hi, welcome to GrOwFlO! This app will ensure that flower lovers are able to take care of their
        plants while doing something they always do: check the weather. Users are able to type in almost every city
        in the world and are able to get the temperature reading and a message explaining how to take care of their plant
        in that type of environment.\n\n
        Also, users can set alarms for when they should water their plants and read random facts about Earth Day through activities found in the top-right menu.\n\n
        Lastly, the more users use the app, the more points you can get to unlock trees!

        Thanks to VClouds @ DevianArt for the weather photos! (http://vclouds.deviantart.com/art/VClouds-Weather-Icons-179152045)
