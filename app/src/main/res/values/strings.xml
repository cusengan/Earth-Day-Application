        Hi, welcome to GrOwFlO! This app will ensure that flower lovers are able to take care of their
        plants while doing something they always do: check the weather. Users are able to type in almost every city
        in the world and are able to get the temperature reading and a message explaing how to take care of their plant
        in that type of environment.\n\n
